[Communities meetup Chef, Docker, Openstack, Puppet](http://eventregist.com/e/ChefDockerOpenStack)

[Container is Future](http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelDucy/the-future-of-everything-37344357). But how to move to new trend (container may not future)? Maybe you already have used Chef or Puppet for your configuration management. Should you trash those tool? Of course No. One of my answer is using [packer](https://www.packer.io/). In this talk, I introduced what is packer and how to use it with docker and chef or puppet.
